# React Fake Store Application

This repository hosts the starter-code written during the live-demo covering the Fake Store application for the React module.
Feel free to clone or download this repository and use it as starter code for building your project.

NOTE: You still need to add two more pages / components:
- A page to update/edit products. (This should make an HTTP PUT request to update a product with the Fake Store API)
- A page to delete products. (This should make an HTTP DELETE request to delete a product with the Fake Store API)

You can make your HTTP requests via either Axios or Fetch.
The 'AddProduct' component in the /components folder of this repository has an example of how to make an HTTP POST request with Axios.
The 'ProductList' component in the /components folder of this repository has an example of how to make an HTTP GET request with Axios.

The Fake Store API documentation has examples of how to make relevant HTTP requests with Fetch:
